        <h1 id="about-us">The Ladiyfest 2017 Crew's Concept</h1>
        <p>
        Our Ladiyfest is a self-organized, non-commercial and queer-feminist event.
        At this long weekend we want to party hard – at concerts with great queer-feminist
        bands and after show parties, at empowering workshops, at actions on the streets
        and in political discussions. As musicians, artists, writers and poets, bloggers,
        computer-nerds, activists, scientists and craftspersons we create the program
        ourselves. At least for some time we want to overcome the gender normativity which
        is present  not only in our everyday lives but also in the anarchist DIY culture.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Ladiyfest is part of a history of Lad(i)yfests. The idea was born in the 2000s
        within the RiotGrrrl movement. At that point the idea was (and still is) to
        strengthen women within in a cis-male dominated music scene and to make their
        positions visible. The term 'Lady' was supposed to get a new meaning – so to
        say as a name for the already grown up RiotGrrrls. Throughout the extension of
        Ladyfest to LaDIYfest we want to break the binary and normative gender system
        that for some of us is linked to the term 'Lady'. This means: We want to create
        more awareness on the existence of more than two gender identities in this world
        and we want to point out exclusions and discriminations happening within the
        queer-feminist scene. Racist exclusions and discriminations, too, have always
        occured within the feminist scene, even if often unconsciously. Together we want
        to fight for a feminism in which we can celebrate our differences.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Ladiyfest is a self-organized festival. It's alive through all of us and we are
        organizing it together: With the knowledge, perspectives, skills, contacts and with
        the things everyone is bringing along to share them with the group. We actively take
        part in societal circumstances, having exchanges with each other about our struggles,
        we network and learn from and with each other. Emancipatory, strengthening, constructive.
        </p>
        <p>
        We all know: Not only heteronormative cis-men are organizing concerts, editing zines,
        making music, performing, writing or are otherwise creative. Although people with
        other gender identities are underrepresented, they are also very active in non-commercial
        (D.I.Y.) scenes. We want to support the creative commitment of Women, Lesbians,
        Trans*- and Inter*-people and sexually non-normative people and contribute to it ourselves.
        </p>

        <h2>Ladiyfest Leipzig 2017</h2>
        <p>
        It is the first time in five years that a new group has formed to organize another
        Ladiyfest in Leipzig. In most countries the situation for people that are being
        discriminated against because of their gender identity, country of origin, colour
        of skin, sexuality and/or concepts of (romantic) relationships is still (or again)
        very miserable. That's why we try to focus on political exchange and networking
        with queer/feminist groups and movements at the Ladiyfest 2017: How does the
        situation look like in different places for the mentioned marginalized people?
        Which unions and alliances already exist within societal struggles? And how can
        we collectively create and form radical resistance structures? How can we form
        a comprehensive queer-feminist movement in which different queer and feminist
        ideas and realities of life find their place? We want to create more opportunities
        to support each other and to become audible and visible!
        </p>
        <p>
        At the same weekend another two big events will happen: The demonstration at the
        'International Day Against Homo-, Inter*- and Trans*phobia'
        <a href="http://stura.uni-leipzig.de/suche/IDAHIT%20http" target="_blank">(IDAHIT)</a>
        in Leipzig, which we invite you all to join. In Cologne the
        „<a href="http://nsu-tribunal.de/" target="_blank">Tribunal: NSU Komplex auflösen!</a>“
        ('Tribunal: Dismantle the National Socialist Underground'; a Nazi Terrorist Group),
        which is a historical trial against the societal interconnection  of the NSU.
        In this public trial the people affected by the NeoNazi-Terror can and will finally
        speak up. We want to follow this event during the Ladiyfest via live ticker.
        In our opinion, it is very important to link and connect these events with
        each other, because different queer, feminist and anti-racist struggles
        belong together!
        </p>

        <h2>Who is invited & Awareness</h2>
        <p>
        In the first place the Ladiyfest invites people who identify as Women, Lesbian,
        Trans* and Inter* (WLTI*) and who identify as queer/feminist. The abbreviation
        WLTI* wishes to also include more marginalized gender identities that are not
        being mentioned here explicitly. Most workshops and reading events are open for
        WLTI* - the invitiation policy and the content of the workshops was left to the
        respective tutor. The concerts, parties and lectures are open to all people that
        are in solidarity with the Ladiyfest-idea.
        </p>
        <p>
        The reason why - at least during daytime - the Ladiyfest will be an exclusive
        space for WLTI* is that we want to escape from patriarchal society, at least
        for a little while. We want to exchange and organize with each other, do great
        stuff together and have fun – without having to deal with the  daily patriarchal
        power relations.
        </p>
        <p>
        But we all have internalized these structures and power relations and we all
        reproduce them in our everyday lives. That's why we ask all of us to be aware,
        to take care of and to respect each other. Taking care of each other also
        means to be aware of your own privileges, e. g. white- or cis-privileges, and
        to respect each other in our own definitions of ourselves. For instance,
        pronouns are nothing you can derive from someone's appearance. In this we wish
        to have a sensitive and open interaction, so that as many of us can feel
        comfortable and safe.
        </p>
        <p>
        And of course we find it very important that you offer your support to people
        if they are affected by sexist, racist, trans-,inter-, homophobic and by
        general discriminatory behaviour. Please respect your own boundaries and
        those of others. If there are any incidents and you feel alone with it feel
        welcome to ask people from the organizing-team, at the bar or the entrance -
        they will do their best to support you. We are planning to have an Awareness-Team
        for the duration of the festival.
        </p>

        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
        Our group is open to all who identify as WLTI* (Women, Lesbian, Trans*, Inter*).
        At the moment we are all people that identify as women – as their own definition
        and/or ascribed by society. We are all feminists – we come from different
        (queer-)feminist movements and we are organizing the Ladiyfest as a alliance.
        To make it clear: We are not a homogeneous group which discussed everything
        in detail. Not everyone is sharing the same point of views but we are connected
        through discussing our various emancipatory positions.
        </p>
        <p>
        Positioned as anti-normative and queer/feminist we are motivated by the idea of
        a Ladiyfest. Without patriarchy or oppressing concepts of gender. For freedom,
        courage, fun and self-awareness. And to create change.
        </p>
